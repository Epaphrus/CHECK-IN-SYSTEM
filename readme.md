# Event Check-in System

This is a simple web-based check-in system for events. It uses QR codes to check in attendees.

## Features

- QR code scanning for check-in
- Local storage to maintain check-in status
- Bootstrap for responsive design

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Allow camera access to scan QR codes

## Usage

1. Generate QR codes for each attendee with their information (name, email, title)
2. Attendees present their QR code to the camera
3. The system will display a welcome message if the check-in is successful

Note: This is a front-end only demonstration. In a real-world scenario, you would need a backend server to handle data securely and send confirmation emails.
